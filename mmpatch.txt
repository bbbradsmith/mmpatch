Instructions
============

MMPATCH.EXE is a DOS executable.
It must be run in a DOS environment, just like the game it patches.

Place MMPATCH.EXE in your game folder next to MM.EXE.

Run it under a DOS environment.

A new executable will be created:
  MM1.EXE for Mega Man
  MM3.EXE for Mega Man 3

Run the new executable to play the game.
The setup menu will have a new option to select the game speed.


Purpose
=======

The original release of these games were programmed for very slow
early DOS computers, without an effective timer to limit the game speed
on later, faster computers. This makes these games difficult or impossible
to play on most computers.

This patch fixes that with a very minimal addition of a framerate limit
to correct this problem, making it playable on more or less any computer
that can run DOS, and even modern PCs running FreeDOS.

My only goal was to compensate for issues that stem from computer speed;
the game is otherwise left intact. No attempt was made to alter any of its
original gameplay.


Details
=======

Mega Man receives the following changes:

1. Video synchronization to limit framerate.
2. New setup option for speed.
3. Default setting to EGA with joystick off.
4. Joystick routine modified to automatically adjust for CPU speed.
5. Joystick wait screens now wait for button press rather than hold.

Mega Man 3 receives the following changes:

1. Video synchronization to limit framerate.
2. New setup option for speed.
2. Default setting to EGA with joystick off.
3. Joystick wait screens now wait for button press rather than hold.

Extensive information about the patches is documented in the included
source code file MMPATCH.C, which is a C program. It was compiled with
the Open Watcom compiler.

The MM.EXE executable is expected to have a CRC32 hash of:
  AEA06825 - Mega Man
  06C09829 - Mega Man 3
